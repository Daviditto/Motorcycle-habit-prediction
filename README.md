# Motorcycle-habit-prediction

Motivation
This is a playground competition based around binary classification of motorcyclist's behaviour, living in Moscow, Russia.
Sometimes it is too cold to ride a motorcycle, sometimes - it's nice weather outside, but sometimes it's cold but there's no rain.
Is it possible to make a prediction based on the date and weather if he will ride a motorcycle? Quite likely.

Data
There's 2 years worth of data split into 70%/30% by date. Both training and testing data contain weather information from a nearby airport weather station. Data points are irregular, but are at least weekly and at most daily.
Each day is labeled 1 if a motorcyclist chose to ride a motorcycle or considered weather outside suitable for riding and 0 if they didn't ride based of weather.
